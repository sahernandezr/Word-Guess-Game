    <h1>Mythical Creatures Word Guess Game</h1>

    <p>Press any key to get started!</p>

    <p>The word you need to guess is:</p>

    <p></p>     <!--  //here should appear a number of scores --- equal to the number of letters of the word chosen by the computer -->

    <p>Wins: </p> <!--Number of times user guessed the word correctly-->

    <p>Number of guesses remaining: </p> <!--I am going to give the user six guesses-->

    <p>Letters already guessed: </p> <!--Letters the user has guessed (or chosen even if the letters don't match? that makes more sense to me)-->

    <!--After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it. 
        
        BONUS: when the user wins, display a sound or song.-->
