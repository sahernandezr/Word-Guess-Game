# Word-Guess-Game

In this Mythical Creatures version of Hangman, the user needs to guess the word.

The user can input their guesses in lowercase or uppercase.

Every letter the user guess, is listed in the "Letters already used" section. The game only accepts letters and doesn't permit repeated letters.

At the beginning of the game, the user knows how many letters they need to guess. 

Every time the user guesses a letter included in the hidden word, the letter appears.

Every time the user guesses a letter not included in the hidden word, they miss a chance. The user has six chances to chose a wrong letter.

This game was developed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript as a project for the Tec de Monterrey - Trilogy Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
